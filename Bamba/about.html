    <h1>About Bamba's Adventure</h1>
    <p>A video game inspired by classic side–scrolling platform RPG games. Heavily influenced by games like Adventure
      Island and Super Mario World, but also by some ideas from Tomb Rider Saga Reboot. This game seeks to bring the
      retro nostalgia of a SNES and Arcade era for modern gamers. With a beautiful, nostalgic, piano music setting the
      atmosphere for each level. NPCs shares actual facts about how human activity is affecting the artic's
      biodiversity in an attempt to create awareness on climate change and residual waste. It’s also a tribute to my
      dog Bamba, and my first attempt at developing a full concept videogame.</p>

      <h2>Gameplay</h2>
      <p>
        As any side–scrolling platform RPG, the basics are to move left and right, jump, step on enemies, grab coins and
        objects that give you extra life. Every level adds different kinds of enemies. Some may throw things at Bamba,
        some may chase her, some may attack her by surprise from above the sky, or from below the water. More than a
        lineal story, the game is focused on exploration.
