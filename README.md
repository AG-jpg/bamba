## Bamba's Adventure

A video game inspired by classic side–scrolling platform RPG games. Heavily influenced by games like Adventure Island and Super Mario World, but also by some ideas from Tomb Rider Saga Reboot. This game seeks to bring the retro nostalgia of a SNES and Arcade era for modern gamers. With a beautiful, nostalgic, piano music setting the atmosphere for each level. NPCs shares actual facts about how human activity is affecting the artic's biodiversity in an attempt to create awareness on climate change and residual waste. It’s also a tribute to my dog Bamba, and my first attempt at developing a full concept videogame.

### Welcome to the Snowy Lands

Deep in the mountains, you‘ll find the Snowy Lands. A place full of trees, mountains, rivers, waterfalls, caves, and fantasy creatures living in small towns. From the Main Land to the Mushroom  Village, the Karly Falls and the Iceberg Sea, Bamba, the adventurous explorer dog will travel far and wide this wild land to discover its secrets and treasures.
