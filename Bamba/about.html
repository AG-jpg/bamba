      <h1>About Bamba's Adventure</h1>
      <p>A video game inspired by classic side–scrolling platform RPG games. Heavily influenced by games like Adventure
        Island and Super Mario World, but also by some ideas from Tomb Rider Saga Reboot. This game seeks to bring the
        retro nostalgia of a SNES and Arcade era for modern gamers. With a beautiful, nostalgic, piano music setting the
        atmosphere for each level. NPCs shares actual facts about how human activity is affecting the artic's
        biodiversity in an attempt to create awareness on climate change and residual waste. It’s also a tribute to my
        dog Bamba, and my first attempt at developing a full concept videogame.</p>

        <h2>About Bamba</h2>
        <p>Bamba’s Adventure it’s not only my first attempt on developing a full concept videogame, but also a tribute
          to my dog: Bamba.<br>
          <br>
          She is a Canaanite dog. Rescued from a Bediun village in the south of Israel, and adopted by us when she was 2
          months old.<br>
          <br>
          Her name was given because of her colors, similar to a “goldish-brown” peanut snack famous in Israel. But it’s
          also the name of a Mexican song, originally from the state I was born in, and made famous by 50’s musician
          Ritchie Valens. So in a way, Bamba carries in her name a fusion of my two home countries.
